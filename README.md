# Try Out Development Containers: Python

A **development container**, from now on _dev container_, is a running
[Docker](https://www.docker.com) container with a well-defined tool/runtime
stack and its prerequisites.

> You can try out development containers with
> **[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)** or
> **[Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)**

This is a template project that using a _dev container_, automatically
configures a **`Python`** development environment with few easy steps.
